## Project Overview

Snake-Game is a normal snake gaming project as we used to play in our mobile phones earlier. In this game the snake can be moved using arrow keys. To move the snake left we will use left arrow key, to move it to right we will use right arrow key, to move up we will use upper arrow key, and to move down we will use down arrow key. As the snake eats food gets bigger.
